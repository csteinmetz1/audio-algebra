Experimental research code exploring MIR / signal processing tasks with
latent audio representations (“embeddings”)

## Install

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/drscotthawley/audio-algebra.git
```

(Do not rely on out-of-date binaries on PyPI/conda.)

## How to use

Apart from the “Destructo” demo notebook, most of this repository is
still under very active development / work in progress. So, for now only
“Destructo” is usable; refer to it directly for instructions.
